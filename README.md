# Python-Projects-Construction-Data-Analysis
Graphs that explain construction data

## Introduction 
This repository analyses and visualises construction data in order to provide insights. It uses Python as the main programming language and Google collab notebooks as the environment. The main aim of this project is to find useful insights that can be used to better prepare for future projects. The data comes from a number of places but is primarily exported from BIM models in .cvs or .xls  or xlsx format. The data is cleaned and manipulated for analysis purposes. 

## Types of Data
A variety of data can be exported from a construction project and used to monitor IoT (Internet of Things) devices, project programs, and budgets, and site conditions, just to name a few. The data collected in this project is:<br>

## Questions
The questions that this project attempts to answer is:<br>
* Where could our organisation benefit the most from data-driven insights?<br>
* How can data be used to gain buy-in of a project?<br>
* How can the value of the project be increased via consistency?<br>
* What data can be used to articulate why changes are happening?<br>

## Why is this project important?
The following images explain why it is important to enhance data collection and processing in the construction industry. <br>
